Brief Description of the project:-

Today, it has become very difficult for people to find a room with preferred needs. Especially for people like Bachelors, who move to a new place face a lot of difficulty in finding a room of affordable budget, so to solve the above problems we use “findR”.The main purpose of our website is that users can easily find rooms without lot of effort and time by sitting at the comfort of their home. Using “findR'' a person can find houses on their own preferences. Users will get recommendations based on their interests. The user can choose a room-mate based on his/her availability. In addition to all these we are even providing service for the Home Owners to get their houses registered with us to make it visible to prospective future tenants .
